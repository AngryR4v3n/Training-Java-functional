# Training-Java-functional
This repo contains a program that was done to train myself in the usage of Streams and some functional programming in Java


## Usage
At the moment, I'm still building the deploy using Docker so a .jar with the required dependency will be uploaded by now.
This was developed using Java JDK 17

Main class is AirportProgram.java
